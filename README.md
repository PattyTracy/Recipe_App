# Recipe_App
I completed this project as part of a Thinkful Engineering Flex program assignment.

It takes the place of a battered box of stained index cards sitting on the kitchen counter, preserving recipes from a user's collection in an easy-to-access format
Recipes can be added, deleted, viewed and saved, making it a handy way for a young cook to broaden their repertoire.

The Home Page shows a truncated view of all the recipes in the file.
